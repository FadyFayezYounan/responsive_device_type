# Responsive Device Type Example

This example shows how to use `responsive_device_type` to drive layouts with
`DeviceTypeBuilder` and app-wide breakpoints using `DeviceBreakpoints`.

## What to try

- Resize the window (desktop/web) or rotate your device.
- Watch the navigation switch between a drawer/bottom bar and a rail.
- See the grid change its column count based on the detected device type.

## Run

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run
```
